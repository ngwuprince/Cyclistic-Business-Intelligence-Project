# Cyclistic-Business-Intelligence-Project

**Project Background info:**
Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel between stations at these locations. Cyclisticâ€™s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. The team wants to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.
**Project goals:**
- Create a table or map visualization exploring starting and ending station locations, aggregated by location. 
- Create a visualization showing which destination (ending) locations are popular based on the total trip minutes. 
- Create a visualization that focuses on trends from the summer of 2015. 
- Create a visualization showing the percent growth in the number of trips year over year. 
- Gather insights about congestion at stations. 
- Gather insights about the number of trips across all starting and ending locations. 
- Gather insights about peak usage by time of day, season, and the impact of weather. 
**The ask/metrics:**
- **Specific:** BI insights must clearly identify the specific characteristics of a successful product. They must demonstrate how customers are currently using bikes and what impacts demand at station locations. 
- **Measurable**: Each trip should be evaluated using starting and ending location, duration, variables such as time of day, season, and weather. For example, do customers use Cyclistic less when it rains? Or does bikeshare demand stay consistent? Does this vary by location and user types (subscribers vs. non-subscribers)? 
- **Action-oriented:** These outcomes must prove or disprove the theory that location, time, season, and weather impact user demand. Then, the Cyclistic team will use this knowledge to refine future product development. 
- **Relevant:** All metrics must support the primary question: How can we build a better Cyclistic experience? 
   **Time-bound:** Analyze data that spans at least one year to see how seasonality affects usage. Exploring data that spans multiple months will capture peaks and valleys in usage.
